        <h1>RC Cars</h1>
        <h3>Author: Mohamed Adiy Ali</h3>

        <p>
          Driving remote controlled vehicles are a hobby whose popularity is
          increasing day by day. Among these vehicles are RC helicopters, RC
          planes and RC cars. Personally, I like RC cars much better. RC cars,
          out of the box, can do speeds of upto 100mph. With some mods, they can
          do upto 200mph or more.

          One of my friends, Mohamed Zayaan, also loves RC cars and he made a
          blog on it as well.

        <h1>My personal RC car</h1>
        <p>I would really like to get one of those RC cars in the future. But for now, I own a VKAR racing Bison V3. It is a great car, however mine kept having some issues such as ripping the tires off of the rims and losing hardware while driving and stripping a very important gear in the steering servo. After resolving them the car is really fun and super fast. My car can do 62mph or 100kph with a 4S LiPo battery. Mine currently uses a 3S LiPo battery. In order to run 4S safely without blowing the car's tires up, some modifications are needed. I plan on getting new wheels and new hex hubs to fit the new wheels. In addition to this I plan on getting a 4S battery and charger.</p>
